Mac service for switching wifi on/off with a keyboard shortcut

**Instructions:**

- Download the file, double click and when prompted, choose Install.

- Once installed, it will be registered as a mac service but it still needs to be enabled.

- Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services and find "WiFiSwitch" from the list.

- Tick the checkbox left to it, select the item and click on "add shortcut" button to the right of it.

Try to assign a unique shortcut because if current application uses the same shortcut, then switch will not work.

Enjoy!
